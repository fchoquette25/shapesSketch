What was most challenging for me during this process was understanding how to code this type of way. It was a bit confusing for me understanding how to scale the code to the frame, but after some failed attempts I think I got the hang of it. This is the part that makes more sense to me now that I have gotten the practice. Nevertheless, I still find it to be harder than the other type of code drawing that we were using before. I am most proud of my trial and error process, and how I was able to power through the mistakes and the misunderstandings of the assignment.
